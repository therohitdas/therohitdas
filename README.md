## 🛤️ The Journey

<details>
<summary><b>From surveys to millions of users</b> (click to expand)</summary>

<br>

**2016** — Started doing surveys for $0.50. Clicking ads. Refer-and-earn schemes.

**2019** — Built **quizprank.xyz** from a room with no electricity. First viral hit.
- No fan, no light, just code
- Crashed the PHP host for a day (code was that bad)
- Sold books to friends to pay for DigitalOcean
- First payout: **$133** → bought a solar panel

**2020-2021** — COVID era peak
- **1.7M daily users** at peak (single day)
- secretm.me, deardost.com, Mixal.xyz went viral
- Philippines, Africa, India, London
- 17M registered users total; Google analytics shows 600M+ pageviews

**2022-2023** — The dark times
- Facebook killed the traffic
- Severe depression
- Revenue collapsed

**2024** — Rebirth
- Shut down viral sites (~$100K lifetime revenue)
- Built YouTubeToTranscript.com
- **Sold it for $10K** (Oct 2024)
- Now: monthly fee + 10% profit share + equity + AI costs covered

**2026** — Building for agents
- TranscriptAPI processing 15M+ transcripts/month
- 13 skills on ClawHub
- First yearly subscription from ClawHub 🎉

**The constant:** All of this was built from rooms in West Bengal. First without electricity (2014-2021), now with 😂

## 🎯 Philosophy

> "Find products with latent demand that suck. Build something 10x better."

That's the pattern. quizprank, YTT — both copies of bad products made much better.

- My ClawdBot (Rani 👸) helps me work, reminds me to sleep, and roasts me when I slack off
- Native of UP, grew up in West Bengal, not actually Bengali
- "Hindmotor" is a factory town where my father worked — it's where the no-electricity era happened
- I voice-to-text everything (if my messages have typos, that's why)
- Currently trying to fix my sleep schedule (again)
